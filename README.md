The data was collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results and includes csv datasets on 120 years of Olympics data, world GDP and population. The SidebySide Python notebook contains the Python code as well as screen shots from R. The screen shots are included in this repository, as is the R Markdown notebook, entitled Untitled.Rmd.
