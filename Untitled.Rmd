## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
olympics <- read.csv('athlete_events.csv',header=TRUE)
pop = read.csv('world_pop.csv')
gdp = read.csv("world_gdp.csv",skip=3)
head(olympics)
```
```{r}
# rename column
colnames(olympics)[8] <- "Country.Code"
head(olympics)
```
```{r}
head(gdp)
```


```{r}
# drop a colum in gdp
gdp <- gdp[-c(3,4)]
head(gdp)
```
```{r}
# melt
mm <- melt(gdp, id=c("Country.Name","Country.Code"))
tail(mm)
```
```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
